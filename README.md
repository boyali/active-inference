# active-inference

An attempt at implementing a toy model of a simple cognitive agent minimizing its informational free energy through variational inference (as described by Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle). This model is highly inspired by [McGregor et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04187.pdf).
